1.Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
example: 
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")

the error is: IndentationError: expected an indented block

2.You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")
the error is : IndentationError: unexpected indent
